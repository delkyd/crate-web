Docker is currently one of the most spoken about tech projects right now and it's hard to believe that it's only two years old. As part of the celebrations, the Docker team decided to host [more than a dozen open-source-a-thon parties](http://docker.party/events/) around the World. Not only to help people learn how to contribute to the project, but also donating $50 for every contribution to the [Oceanic Society](http://www.oceanicsociety.org/).

In our first blog post as part of the celebrations, we attended the party in [Berlin](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Berlin/events/220945833/). The event was held at Soundcloud's main office in its vast Kitchen area. We took a crate of cakes along to accompany the pizza and drinks which were greatly appreciated as hacker fuel.

After a quick introduction on how to get involved, the 100+ participants broke out into areas of interest and experience. These were Beginner, Advanced and Documentation working on various components such as Core Docker, Swarm, Compose and Machine. I opted to lend a hand with documentation across the components as I have no experience in coding with Go and always like getting involved with documentation as I feel it's an area of Open Source project contribution that can get forgotten. I helped a small group get up and running with Docker and we looked through some issues together, managing to submit fixes for several, hopefully also raising a few hundred dollars for the Oceanic Society.

### Get Involved
As a relative newcomer to Docker I found working through the issue queues and exploring code a great way to gain a better understanding of the project and how to use it. It's an experience I would recommend to anyone wanting to get started in coding or the tech world. The Docker community is a friendly and fast moving one that everyone can bring something to.

If you weren't able to attend a Docker Party event, you can still be involved in the [online open-source-a-thon](http://docker.party/online/) and all contributions until April 19th will still count as part of the party celebrations and charity donations. Full instructions can be found on the same site.
