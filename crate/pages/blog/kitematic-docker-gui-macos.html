I know I'm going to sound uncool amongst my developer peers, but I love GUIs. Whenever I discover a new tool for making my development life easier, my next step is always to see if there is a GUI companion. So, for the last month I have been using Kitematic to manage my containers and have found it a great visual way of learning more about Docker.

Last week, [the Docker team announced](https://blog.docker.com/2015/03/kitematic-a-docker-gui-joins-the-docker-family/) that the folks behind Kitematic where joining them in San Francisco. So it seemed high time for Crate to publish a blog post on using the tool.

It's a simple [download](https://kitematic.com/download) and on its first run Kitematic will handle the installation of all dependencies for you ([VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is the only one). Yes Mac Users, you no longer need to use Boot2Docker if you don't want to!

On launch the Docker VM will start automatically.

The application has some preferences that have become far simpler as development progressed, these relate to reporting and whether to shut down the VM on quitting Kitematic.

## Features

Aside from the easy creation of containers, Kitematic has several other useful features, these include:

* **Launching Terminal**: Easily open the Docker terminal or the terminal of one of your containers.

* **View logs**: One of my issues with containerized development is being able to see what's going on, Kitematic gives you easy access to logs.

* **Settings**: Kitematic provides a simple interface to the viewing and setting of ports, environment variables, naming and folder sharing.

## Problems and Gotchas
Kitematic is in beta, so there will be some inconsistencies and room for improvement. I found the earlier versions of Kitematic had more features, some of which I hope will return in a later version. Here are a couple of nuggets I found during use.

* **Boot2Docker**: If you already have Boot2Docker installed you will end up with two Docker VMs, this may or may not be a problem to you and you can probably remove one of them.

* **Not-quite-native**: Kitematic is not a 'proper' Mac app, but some form of hybrid web app. This is not a big deal, but does mean the interface is not completely 'Mac like'.

* **VM Shutdown on quit**: I have found this setting sometimes needs to be toggled off and on for it to work.

* **No images**: In earlier versions of Kitematic you could manage images, hopefully this will make a future return.

* **No instructions** : Occasionally there are special steps in setting up a Docker container from certain images and there is no way to access these details from within the GUI.

* **More Control**: In earlier versions of Kitematic there were more options for stopping and starting containers individually. Again, I hope these will make a comeback.
