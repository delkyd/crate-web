I know I'm going to sound uncool amongst my developer peers, but I love GUIs. Whenever I discover a new tool for making my development life easier, my next step is always to see if there is a GUI companion. So, for the last month I have been using Kitematic to manage my containers and have found it a great visual way of learning more about Docker.

Last week, [the Docker team announced](https://blog.docker.com/2015/03/kitematic-a-docker-gui-joins-the-docker-family/) that the folks behind Kitematic where joining them in San Francisco. So it seemed high time for Crate to publish a blog post on using the tool.

It's a simple [download](https://kitematic.com/download) and on its first run Kitematic will handle the installation of all dependencies for you ([VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is the only one). Yes Mac Users, you no longer need to use Boot2Docker if you don't want to!

On launch the Docker VM will start automatically.

The application has some settings, these relate to reporting and whether to shut down the VM on quitting Kitematic.

## Features

Aside from the easy creation of containers, Kitematic has several other features, these include:

* **Launching Terminal**: Open the Docker terminal or the terminal of one of your containers.

* **View logs**: One of my issues with containerized development is being able to see what's going on, Kitematic gives you easy access to logs.

* **Settings**: Kitematic provides a simple interface to the viewing of ports, environment variables, naming and folder sharing.

## Using Kitematic with Crate

For the purposes of this example, I will follow our existing [Docker guide](/docs/docker/) and replace each step with how you might accomplish it using Kitematic.

Our first command is `docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300 crate:latest`

Kitematic can't run containers on the fly in this manner, everything has to be set up first. To acheive the above we would undertake the following steps:

1. From the Kitematic home page search for 'crate'. You will see several results, we want the one marked as 'official'. The _latest_ version will be automatically used.
2. Click its 'create' button, it will now download the image and run straight away, in 'detached' mode (the `-d` flag above).
3. Newer versions of Kitematic no longer allow you to change the port(s) that a container is published to, so you're stuck with the automatically assigned ones unless you jump into command line.

The next command is `docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300 -v <data-dir>:/data crate`

A persistent data directory has also been set for us and can be changed in the _Settings_ -> _Volumes_ tab.

Next we have setting crate settings via the `-Des` flag, i.e. `-Des.config=/path/to/crate.yml`. I can't find a way to do this from teh Kitematic GUI yet.

Settings environment variables, for example:

`docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300 --env CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=32g crate`

To do this, click the _Settings_ tab and add the relevant name/variable pair in the _Environment Variables_ section.

Despite these restrictions, Crate's clustering still works fine with containers created in Kitematic. I created 3 containers, then opened up the IP address of any one of the containers mapped to port 4200, with '/admin' suffixed to the address. In the admin console I can see 3 nodes, I add or remove containers and the number updates. Running through the typical Crate Trial (Importing Tweets from the 'Get Started' tab) everything works as expected.

## Problems and Summary

I found the earlier versions of Kitematic had more features and control, some of which I hope will return in a later version. Here are a couple of other tips I found during use.

* **Boot2Docker**: If you already have Boot2Docker installed you will end up with two Docker VMs, this may or may not be a problem to you and you can probably remove one of them.

* **No images**: In earlier versions of Kitematic you could manage images, hopefully this will make a future return.

* **No instructions** : Occasionally there are special steps in setting up a Docker container from certain images and there is no way to access these details from within the GUI.

In summary, Kitematic is aimed at getting up and running with Docker quickly and for those who don't want to do anything complicated. If you are happy with container defaults and have no complex requirements, then it will be fine for you. Any containers and images you create and configure via the command line will appear in Kitematic, so at least you have an integrated place to manage things.

I look forward to seeing how the application develops over time.
